# Commit Template
Commits shall be written after conventions from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) with following types:
 - fix for bug fixes
 - feat for added features
 - docs for documentation
 - chore for housekeeping
 - style for style improvements
 - refactor for code refactors
 - perf for perfomance improvements 
 - test for testing commits
 - org for commits needed by University
 
This means commits have to follow this syntax:
```
<type>[optional scope in brackets]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```
